# Advent of Code
My solutions for Advent of Code in Rust, Typescript, and Python.

For 2025 I'll mostly be focusing on Rust, unless I feel like trying out something new.

I try to leave comments along the way to explain my reasoning, but if you have any questions feel free to ask me to elaborate on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/quilling.dev).

Jump straight to my 2025 Day 1 solution's [Dial struct here!](https://tangled.org/quilling.dev/advent-of-code/blob/main/src/2025/day1/rust/common.rs) Modulo arithmetic handles the dial rotation wraparound logic, and for the second part we just determine the magnitude of the rotation using division before applying it.

For 2025 Day 2 I used some straightforward [pattern checking](https://tangled.org/quilling.dev/advent-of-code/blob/main/src/2025/day2/rust/common.rs) which is easily repeated on substrings in a loop for part two.
